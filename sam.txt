welcome to git,
    Git is a widely used distributed version control and source code management system. It effectively tracks changes to source code, enabling effortless branching, merging, and versioning.

This Git tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals. It covers a range of topics, from fundamental to advanced concepts of Git and GitHub. The tutorial includes instructions on downloading and installing Git, creating new repositories, utilizing Git Bash, managing Git stash, downloading Git, executing Git commands, working with Git branches, etc
What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) that allows developers to track changes in their codebase, collaborate with others, and manage different versions of their projects efficiently

Git was developed by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for Linux kernel development.
Git is 2.45.1 is the Lastest Verions of GIT, released on May 2024.
Why Use Git?
Version Control: Git helps in tracking changes, allowing you to revert to previous states if something goes wrong.
Collaboration: It enables multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without interfering with each other’s work.
Backup: Your entire project history is saved in a Git repository, providing a backup of all versions.
Branching and Merging: Git’s branching model allows you to experiment with new features or bug fixes independently from the main project.
Open Source Projects: Most open source projects use Git for version control. Learning Git allows you to contribute to these projects.
Industry Standard: Git is widely used in the software industry, making it an essential skill for developers.
Working with Git
Initializing a Repository: When you initialize a folder with Git, it becomes a repository. Git logs all changes made to a hidden folder within that repository.
Staging Changes: Git marks modified files as “staged.” Staging prepares changes for a snapshot you want to keep.
Committing Changes: Once staged changes are satisfactory, commit them. Git maintains a complete record of each commit.
What is Github?
GitHub, a hosting service for Git repositories, allows you to access and download projects from any computer. Here’s what you can do with GitHub:

Store Repositories: GitHub hosts your repositories.
Collaborate: Work with other developers from any location.
Version Control: Manage collaborative workflows using Git and GitHub.

Internal Working of Git
Git uses a decentralized model where each developer has their own copy of the repository and works immediately on the project. Git manages the projects with repositories and can clone a project to operate locally on it.

With staging and committing it track changes and control. You can pull the latest code of the project to the local copy, and push local updates to the main projects.

Git and GitHub – FAQs
What is GitHub?
Git and GitHub are not the same, GitHub makes tools that use Git. GitHub is the popular host of code and maintained by Microsoft since 2018.

Why Should I Use Git?
Git is a useful tool that helps to manage changes in code or any documents, It generally allows collaboration between developers and writers and enables them easy version control.

Can Git be used for non-code files?
Yes, Git can be used to manage changes happening in any text-based files, documents, configuration files, and even images. However, Git may not be the best tool for managing large binary files.

How do I resolve conflicts in Git?
When changes areStart done in the same file by different developers then conflict occurred. To solve this, you need to first identify the lines of code which is conflicting then make the necessary changes, and commit the changes to the repository.
