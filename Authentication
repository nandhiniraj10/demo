Understanding Authentication and Authorization

Authentication and authorization are fundamental concepts in information security, often used interchangeably due to their similar contexts. However, they serve distinct roles in the security process.

Authentication: Verifying Identity

Authentication is the process of verifying a user's identity to ensure they are who they claim to be. This is typically the first step in the security process and is crucial for establishing a secure environment. Authentication mechanisms often require users to provide credentials, such as a username and password, which are then compared against a database of authorized users. If the credentials match, the user is granted access.

Methods of Authentication:

Single-Factor Authentication: Involves one layer of security, usually a password.

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Adds an additional layer, such as a code sent to a user's phone.

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Incorporates two or more layers, including something the user knows (password), something the user has (security token), and something the user is (biometric verification).
